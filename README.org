* Introduction

2018 basketball project

Use player trajectories to predict player

We use this [[https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1UUQPWn69poKy3clSZHIpD6xedAG1rGOM1_9YFDfq0PU/edit#slide=id.g42b656bfa3_0_0][Google Slides]] to keep the notes

* Code Structure

We reuse the code genearted for 2017 basketball project. For information on
that, refer to README_2017.org

Instead of focusing on doubleteaming, we record the whole possession: where a
possession is the time from the player getting the ball until ball movement
stops.

The data is contained in ../traj_data ordered by gamecode. To generate this
data, we use ../code/pipeline4.py.

** legacy

Legacy code (eg. definition of possesion) is put into legacy folder

** lib

Contains useful code for current project

* Design choices

1. Should we normalize x, y location to the right?

2. Should we only use data when people cross half the court?
